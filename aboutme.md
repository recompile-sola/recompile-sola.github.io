We're passionate about teaching young folks Software Engineering.  

### The Team

Hi! My name is Anthony Singhavong. I grew up in the Inland Empire and I'm now residing in South Los Angeles, California with my little family. By day, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Reddit](reddit.com) and by night, I get to teach young folks from the neighborhood a little about Software Engineering. I hold a <b>Masters of Science, Computer Science</b> from [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) that I earned completely online and I also love to eat. 

Hello, I'm Chris Singhavong. I work as a Frontend Engineer at [Data Robot](https://www.datarobot.com/). I love making clean interfaces and writing good code. I like to play ball when I'm not in front of a computer.
